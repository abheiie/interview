    "- Pros \n",
    "    - You can be sure that a class has only a single instance.\n",
    "    - You gain a global access point to that instance.\n",
    "    - The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.\n",

    "    -  Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The pattern solves two problems at the time.\n",
