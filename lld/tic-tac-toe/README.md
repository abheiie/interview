# 1. REQUIREMENT GATHERING

## Current Scope 
    -   Size of board (3X3)
    -   How many Players (2)
    -   Type of Players (Human, Bot)

* Separation of concern should be addressed
* Project structured well across multiple files/ packages
* Write unit tests
* No need of GUI

## Design Round Expectations
    Good Design 

## Machine Round Expectations
    The core Focus should be on Implementing whatever asked end to end, then look at optimization
